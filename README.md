My first unguided project!

Applying learned concepts to practice and creating a text-based game to solidify them to memory.

This project has the following objectives:

Create a foundation that has the potential to be expanded

Define Classes, Subclasses, Weapons, Object weights, NPC stats, and battle dynamics.

Create a short story with multiple missions and endings

Make the game fun (Optional)
